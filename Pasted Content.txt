2. Kanban Dashboard: Real-time updates with drag-and-drop capabilities for task management.
3. Process Automation: Automatically fetch government bidding documents, process them, and store the results in the database.
4. Full Security: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), secure authentication, and PGP encryption for sensitive documents.
5. Compliance: Ensure the system complies with Brazilian LGPD (General Data Protection Law), including data anonymization and retention policies.
6. Production-Ready Deployment: Scalable deployment with Docker, CI/CD pipeline, and monitoring setup.

 1. Core System Architecture
This system will be designed with the following components:

 Backend:
- FastAPI: Chosen for its performance and ease of creating RESTful APIs.
- Celery: For background task management such as data fetching and processing.
- PostgreSQL: A robust relational database to store bidding details, supplier data, and more.
- Redis: Used as a caching layer to speed up frequent operations.
  
 Frontend:
- React: The frontend will be built using React for dynamic, responsive interfaces, including the Kanban board.
  
 AI:
- Sentence Transformers and scikit-learn: Used for supplier scoring and recommendation via NLP and cosine similarity.

 2. Data Pipeline and Automation
The pipeline should handle the fetching, processing, and storing of government bidding data. The core flow will be as follows:

- Fetch data from external APIs (e.g., government portals).
- Process documents using OCR and NLP to extract relevant information (such as tender number, company details, and more).
- Store the processed data in PostgreSQL for further analysis and display.

 3. AI Recommendation Engine
The recommendation system for suppliers will be powered by machine learning models trained to evaluate suppliers based on various criteria:

- Price, Delivery Time, Certifications, Stock: Weighted metrics to rank suppliers.
- Cosine Similarity: Used to compute the similarity between suppliers and the current bidding requirements.

The engine will use pre-trained NLP models (e.g., `bert-base-portuguese`) to extract meaningful data and match it with tender requirements.

 AI Engine Architecture:
- Input: Supplier data (price, delivery time, certifications, etc.)
- Processing: Use cosine similarity and weighted scoring to rank suppliers.
- Output: A list of suppliers ranked by relevance.

 4. Kanban Dashboard
The Kanban dashboard will display the status of each bidding process. The board will be interactive, allowing users to drag and drop tasks to various stages.

 Features:
- Real-Time Updates: The board will update dynamically, showing real-time changes as tasks move through various stages.
- Drag-and-Drop: Users will be able to easily move tasks between stages (e.g., from "Under Review" to "Approved").

 5. Security Implementation
Security is paramount, especially when dealing with sensitive government data.

- OAuth2 & JWT: To handle secure authentication and authorization.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Different user roles (e.g., admin, analyst, user) with specific permissions.
- PGP Encryption: For storing sensitive documents securely.
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling throughout the system to ensure security and reliability.

 6. Data Retention and LGPD Compliance
- Anonymization: Anonymize user data after 6 months of inactivity.
- Data Deletion: Ensure data is deleted after 5 years in compliance with LGPD.
- Audit Logging: Maintain logs of user activities for audit purposes.

 7. Deployment
The system will be packaged using Docker, enabling easy deployment and scaling.

 Docker Compose:
- PostgreSQL: For database persistence.
- FastAPI: Backend service.
- Redis: Caching service.
- Grafana & Prometheus: For monitoring system health and performance.
- Celery Worker: For background task processing.

```yaml

  fastapi:
    image: fastapi_image
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
  celery:
    image: celery_image
    command: celery -A app.worker worker
  postgres:

    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: bids_db
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password

    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

 8. CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline will automate deployments using GitHub Actions.

 Key Steps:
1. Code Build: On every push to the main branch, the code will be built.
2. Tests: Unit tests and integration tests will be executed.
3. Deployment: Deploy the application to the production server with zero downtime.

 9. Monitoring and Alerts
- Prometheus will monitor system health and performance.
- Grafana will visualize the collected data for easy analysis.
- Matrix for Notifications: Use the Matrix client to send alerts regarding important events.

 10. API Documentation
The system will be fully documented using OpenAPI (Swagger). The documentation will include all available endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples.
